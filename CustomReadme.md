Hello! Please ensure you follow these steps for the custom project:

Make sure you are using a Mac operating system.

Follow all the instructions outlined in the customProjectRequirements.txt file.

Execute the sh script_training.sh command after completing the setup.

Subsequently, run the script_test.sh to perform additional tests.

Important Points to Note Before Running:

Confirm that you have downloaded the necessary videos, including those in the 'datasets/train' and test directory accordingly, from the provided Google Drive link.

Access to the Google Drive link has been granted to all Teaching Assistants (TAs) and professors.

Due to the large file sizes, videos are hosted on Google Drive. The primary reason for this is to prevent Git from handling the large video files directly. Please ensure that you clone the repository accordingly.

Clone the Repo : git clone https://github.com/Aneeshreddy00/CCN.git

Google Drive Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ez3GfpeitqDnbNsbypqgblMkvjxWBKZa/view?usp=drive_link

Expected Results: After running sh script_test.sh can be found under expected_results directory.
